<strong>BACKSTORY</strong>

This project was inspired by the "Lyrics Search" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/learn/lecture/17842006#overview" target="_blank">Vanilla JavaScript Udemy Course.</a> I was further exposed to APIs and building more complex JavaScript applications.

<strong>PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS</strong>

While making this API-based project, I saw how important I had to code my program to avoid errors - for instance, I further remembered that I need to concatenate variables (using ``) rather than using regular quotation marks ("") if I wanted to change an HTML element dynamically based on an API element.

<strong>APP OVERVIEW</strong>

1. Search Bar

   The user will input key words of the artist or title they would like to search for.

2. Search Results

   Songs that contain the key words or artist will display the titles closest to what the user is looking for.

3. "Previous/Next" Buttons

   Without loading a new page, users can click these buttons to view the next list of suggested songs, or go back to the previously fetched results.

4. "Show Me The Lyrics!" Button & Lyrics

   When pressed, the "Show Me The Lyrics!" button will show the lyrics of the song selected.

<strong>TECHNOLOGIES USED</strong>

JavaScript

Lyrics API

HTML

CSS

<strong>CHALLENGES</strong>

Time Management: Keeping app development within 1 week scope - I spent 2 weeks building this app.

Concatenation vs Quotation Marks - I kept mixing the two up, causing my app to throw errors at me until I realized I had to concatenate my function rather than use quotation marks.

<strong>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</strong>

Add a button to allow users to start a new search, leading them back to the app homepage.
